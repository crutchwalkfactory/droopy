This is my fork of droopy.
Most notably, I've added two types of inline image support.
I did this so that I can run droopy with images as a single file in my ~/bin/
I use the following entry in my ~/.bash_aliases (or ~/.bashrc)

alias 'droopy.py'='droopy.py -m "O hai there! Please send me your file."'

You can encode your own image with:

$ cat image.png | python -c 'import sys; print sys.stdin.read().encode("base64")' > image.base64

And then paste it into the appropriate part of the droopy executable.
There are a few sample images in the images/ directory.
Feel free to send me some better ones!

I forked this because the original author hasn't responded to patch offerings.
If that's you, feel free to merge my patches.
In the meantime, contributors can send patches to: droopy@shubin.ca

Happy hacking,
James
